# Django App Deployment on AWS

This repository contains configurations and modules for deploying a Django application on AWS using Terraform. The setup includes several modules for creating an ECR repository, ECS cluster, load balancer, and associated configurations.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- AWS CLI configured with necessary permissions and credentials
- Docker installed for building and managing containers

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy your Django app on AWS:

### 1. Configure AWS Provider

Make sure to set up your AWS provider configuration in `provider.tf`:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2" # Replace with your desired AWS region
}
```

### 2. Create ECR Repository

Use the ECR module to create a repository for your Docker images:
```hcl
module "ecr" {
  source      = "./modules/ecr"
  ecr_name    = "ecr" # Define your ECR repository name
  mutability  = "MUTABLE"
  # Additional configurations can be added here
}
```

### 3. Set up ECS Cluster

Configure an ECS cluster for your Django app using the ECS module:
```hcl
module "ecs" {
  source       = "./modules/ecs"
  ecs_name     = "test-ecs-cluster" # Define your ECS cluster name
  familytype   = "service"
  pathJson     = "${file("service.json")}" # Path to your service configurations
  service_name = "my-first-service" # Define your service name
}
```

### 4. Configure Load Balancer

Use the Load Balancer module to set up an Application Load Balancer:
```hcl
module "load_balancer" {
  source = "./modules/load_balancer"
  lb_name = "new-lb1" # Define your Load Balancer name
  lb_type = "application"
  tg_name = "target-group2" # Define your target group name
  # Additional configurations for load balancer settings
}
```

### 5. Additional Configurations

Adjust default VPC and subnet settings as needed for your AWS resources. Configure security groups for load balancer ingress and egress traffic.

### Usage

- Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configurations.
- Execute `terraform plan` to review the planned changes.
- Run `terraform apply` to apply the configurations and deploy the Django app on AWS.

## Notes

- This setup is designed to deploy a Django app on AWS using Terraform modules. Customize the configurations to fit your application requirements.
- Ensure proper configurations and permissions are set to avoid any unexpected changes or issues.
